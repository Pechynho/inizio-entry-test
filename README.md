# INIZIO Entry test
This is a Symfony 4.3 project which I have created for a job interview in the [INIZIO](https://www.inizio.cz/). It fetches 
data from the [ARES API](https://wwwinfo.mfcr.cz/ares/) in XML format, parses them and saves them to a database. User can browse through
these saved items, filter them by attributes and display their detailed information (fetched via AJAX). It also generates RSS feeds 
from a table in the [Sakila Sample Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/). Live demo can be found [here](https://www.inzio-entry-test.pechy-corp.cz).
